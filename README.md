<img src="https://icongr.am/feather/briefcase.svg?size=18&color=000000" /> Once wrote Kotlin for money.<br>
<img src="https://icongr.am/feather/play-circle.svg?size=18&color=000000" /> Wrote C# in Unity for fun.<br>
<img src="https://icongr.am/feather/target.svg?size=18&color=000000" /> Wrote OKRs as a PM for survival.<br>
<img src="https://icongr.am/feather/briefcase.svg?size=18&color=000000" /> Now I just prompt Claude and ship products for love.

### 👤 Who I am

- **Product / Dev-ish** – I live at the intersection of **product**, **engineering**, and **data**
- I enjoy:
  - turning fuzzy ideas into **shippable products**
  - designing **flows that hide complexity** from non-technical users
  - building systems where **data → decisions → feedback loops** are explicit
- Languages: 🇮🇷 فارسی (native), 🇬🇧 English (working)

---

### 🧠 What I'm building

**AI-first Dev & Product Tools**

- 🧪 A **chat-driven IDE** where non-engineers can:
  - describe what they want in natural language
  - let agents manage files, git, tests, and refactors
  - get explanations, diffs, and “why” behind every change

**Signal → Outcome Engine (Trading)**

- Pipelines that:
  - ingest signals (entry, SL, TP1/2/3, time rules)
  - track real market data with gap-handling & late-activation logic
  - label each signal with a robust outcome (TP/SL/expired/confidence levels)
  - feed clean labels into analytics & strategy iteration

---

### 🛠 Toolbox

> I care more about **architecture & UX** than any single framework, but these are my usual tools.

- **Product & UX:** problem framing, discovery interviews, opportunity mapping, roadmapping
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI / Django), Go,
- **Data & infra:** PostgreSQL, Redis, Metabase
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, component-driven UIs
- **Delivery:** Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, feature flags, A/B testing
- **AI:** Claude / GPT, agentic workflows, prompt & tool design

---

### 🧪 Product experiments (live mindset)

I treat my work as a sequence of **small product experiments**, not just tickets.

- 🎯 **Current focus**
  - [ ] Design flows so non-devs can still feel in control of changes
  - [ ] Close the loop between **signal performance** and **product decisions**

- 🧬 **How I like to build**
  - Talk to users early, design backwards from their mental model
  - Start from domain language → state machines → APIs → UI
  - Keep a bias toward small, reversible changes and strong telemetry

---

### 📓 Mini Product Changelog

> A lightweight log of things I care about shipping. I occasionally update this.

- **2025-2026**
  -  Iterating on a **chat-driven IDE** prototype with real users
  -  Hardening the **signal outcome engine** (gaps, late activation, confidence levels)
  -  Standardizing patterns for “agents that can touch production code” safely
---

### 🤝 How I like to collaborate

- Happy in the space between **PM, design, and engineering**
- I enjoy:
  - pairing with engineers on architecture & DX
  - pairing with PMs on discovery and prioritization
  - talking to users and reading between the lines

If you’re working on:

- AI-native dev tools  
- tools for non-technical users to control complex systems  
- trading / data products where **labeling & feedback loops** matter

…feel free to reach out.

> Thanks for scrolling this far.
